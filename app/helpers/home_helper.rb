  def about
    '<p>Home to more than half of all life on Earth, the Ocean covers over 70% of the surface of the planet.</p><p>The ocean contains some of the most productive ecosystems, vast natural resources, and unique habitats on Earth. The ocean also plays a vital role in regulating the planetâ€™s climate. However, the marine environment is facing many pressures, from the impacts of climate change and overfishing to the effects of pollution from microplastics and marine litter.</p><p>Accurate and up-to-date data and information are required to support adaptive conservation and resource management that can help to mitigate these impacts, and to conserve marine species and habitats.</p><p><b>Ocean+ Data</b> addresses this need for information by providing an overview of global marine and coastal datasets of biodiversity importance, including some datasets of regional interest.</p>'
