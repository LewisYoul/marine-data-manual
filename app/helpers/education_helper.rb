This provides students with an opportunity to work with datasets that demonstrate the current state of knowledge with regards to the ocean, while also learning new skills.</p>"

The report concludes with management and policy options at the local, regional and global level that could prevent further losses through effective conservation measures, sustainable management and successful restoration (Chapter 4).",
